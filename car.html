          <h2>Learning from our mistakes</h2>
          The main thing which we learned from the previous race
          was that we have to consider some tolerance when
          creating the components to fit both the regulation limit
          and also the joint created on the car body.
          Another aspect that we learned from was that the
          weight of the car bears greater importance than the pure
          aerodynamic performance, since the acceleration lost is
          significant. Therefore, while creating the car we decided
          to sacrifice some of the aerodynamics of the car to
          reduce its total weight.

          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          While designing the car we took inspiration from various race cars. Our main inspiration still
          remained
          the RB
          x2010 as visible from the support structure of the front
          wing and from the overall shape of the car. Regarding
          the sidepods design and the attachment behind the rear
          wheels, we also drew ideas from the 2024 F1 in School
          world champion car. The profile of the rear wing was
          influenced by the rear wing used in IndyCar during the
          Indy 500, even though we needed to adapt it to fit the
          regulations because of the not foreseen one pillar design.
          To stabilize the car, we took inspiration from the design
          of the inside part of the sidepods in the Lotus 79, the
          first car to take full advantage of the ground effect.
          Even if the sidepods are not as close to the ground as in
          Lotus 79, they help to maintain the car stable and avoid
          up force, without a significant increase to the drag

          <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
          Before starting to design the car we looked into the
          most popular 3D modeling techniques to choose the one
          that fitted best our requirements. Unfortunately, due to
          the relatively small amount of time and our lack of prior
          knowledge about the recommended software Fusion 360,
          when we started the project, we were unable to fully
          follow a specific kind of modeling technique. We
          adopted a mixture between different techniques and we
          mainly followed the tips contained in the tutorials that
          we were given. The two techniques we took inspiration
          from are subdivision modeling and surface modeling

          <h2>CFD simulating</h2>
          We used the suggested Ansys suite for all of our CDF tests. We tested every single model and every
          slight change to
          inform our modifications at best. We imported the model and all the necessary materials for the car
          model in the
          simulation software, in order to have the most precise data possible. We run the computation with
          the
          model in the
          ”air” default model, at a velocity of 20m/s to slightly increase the effect of the drag.
          The data shown in the table and the graph above are
          extracted from the testing of our main models and
          reflect the different ideas we had in terms of
          aerodynamic solutions. Since the Discovery software is
          random-based, we ran the simulation several times not
          only on the same pc, but we also tried different
          hardware setups in order to minimize the impact of the
          randomization.
          As is shown in the calculations, the downforce (or
          symmetrically the upforce) doesn’t affect significantly
          the global performance of the car. On the other hand,
          drag could have a big impact on the final speed, so we
          focused our efforts mostly on maintaining it as low as
          possible.

          <h2>Manifacturing</h2>
            Thanks to our partner Famar, we were able to craft our
            body at Ilma. We started from the block provided, and
            by precisely milling it, we took off materials giving life to
            our prototype. Since we didn’t have access to five axis
            machinery, we had to first mill the bottom part of the
            body, then create a support structure to keep it stable
            and finally mill also its upper part. In the process were
            used drills of different sizes, from larger ones to clear up
            the exceeding material to the smallest one they had, 3
            mm, to refine the car. We also made our own tether
            guide lines, turning them out of aluminum, so that we
            could secure them by screw threads
            Apart from the body and the tether guide lines every
            other component, that is the wings, the halo and the
            support structures, is 3D-printed. We did a bit of
            research to find the best material to use, it turned out
            that PLA was one of the best options in terms of
            availability, costs and additionally it allows for easy and
            perfectly fitted assembly by slightly heating the parts.
            For the axles we used the ones we were provided with,
            having pretty low friction and being really stable
